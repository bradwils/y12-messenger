REFERENCING STRUCT
depending on what is reference, you have a diff structure.
        - lastDbSnapshot always has the last set of data
                - The path will only ever be '/conversations/' or '/users/'
                        - If the path is conversations, then from there the hierachy goes convoID -> users[], messages[].
                                ConvoID is reference as an array within conversations, so it'll be used as lastDbSnapshot[convoID].
                        - If the path is users, then the hierachy goes userID -> data, conversations (assuming i set it up like this).
