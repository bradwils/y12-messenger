almost completely works, but the convo that is created isn't added to the other user's convo list within users/[user]/conversations. it is added for the account that is creating that new conversation though. trying to debug by putting console.log at 93. it is undefined instead.

the other user seems to be undefined instead of (in this case witherform. 
)
try doing it again rn and see what happens and what is output at 93.
